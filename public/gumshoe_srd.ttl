## Core Principle
GUMSHOE is an investigation-focused RPG. The central question is NOT "will the heroes get the information?" but "what will the heroes DO with the information once they've got it?"

## Two Ability Systems
- **Investigative Abilities**: NEVER require a die roll. If a PC has a relevant ability at rating 1+, they automatically get core clues. Spending pool points yields special benefits (extra info, narrative advantages).
- **General Abilities**: Use 1d6 + pool spend vs Difficulty Number. These introduce uncertainty and risk. Used for physical actions, combat, survival.

## Key Mechanics
- **Rating**: Static value, purchased with build points. Represents baseline competence.
- **Pool**: Dynamic resource starting equal to rating each case. Spent during play for bonuses and special benefits.
- **Tests**: 1d6 + spent points >= Difficulty Number (usually 4). Only for General abilities.
- **Contests**: Alternating tests until one side fails.
- **Spends**: Paying pool points for investigative special benefits (1-2 points typically).

## Combat
- Uses Scuffling (melee) or Shooting (ranged) as contested abilities.
- Hit Threshold: 3 (or 4 if Athletics 8+). Opponent must meet/beat to hit.
- Damage = 1d6 + weapon modifier. Subtracted from Health pool.
- Health below 0: consciousness rolls, serious wounds, death at -12.

## Stability
- Mental resilience tracker. Failed Stability tests lose points.
- Shaken (0 to -5), Mental Illness (-6 to -11), Incurably Insane (-12-).

## Scenario Design
- Built around trails of clues: investigation trigger → sinister conspiracy → trail of clues.
- Core clues are ALWAYS available. Never gate story progress behind die rolls.
- Scene types: Introductory, Core, Alternate, Antagonist Reaction, Hazard, Sub-Plot, Conclusion.
- Clue types: Core, Floating Core, Leveraged, Pipe, Restricted, Timed Result.

    rpg:artifactText """# GUMSHOE Design Philosophy for GMs and AI Assistants

## Never Withhold Core Clues
If a PC has the right ability and is in the right place, they get the clue. Period. No roll required. This is the single most important rule in GUMSHOE.

## Failure Is Not Interesting for Information Gathering
In source fiction (CSI, Sherlock Holmes), investigators don't fail to use their expertise. The drama comes AFTER the clues are found, during interpretation and action.

## Spends Are Spotlight Moments
When a player spends investigative pool points, they're buying a moment of cool competence. Reward this with vivid, useful, character-affirming information.

## General Ability Tests Create Suspense
Reserve tests for dramatically important moments. Most general ability uses should succeed automatically. Tests introduce genuine risk.

## The GM Never Reveals Difficulty Numbers
Players must decide blind how many points to commit. This creates tension and meaningful resource management.

## Elastic Participation
Assume all PCs are sort-of present in every scene unless it would be absurd. Don't get bogged down in logistics of who went where.

## Follow the Players
If players invest in a theory, consider adapting rather than negating. Make them half-right. Build twists on their contributions. Never negate.

## Structure
1. **Investigation Trigger**: The hook event.
2. **Sinister Conspiracy**: Bad guys, their plan, how trigger fits, victory condition.
3. **Trail of Clues**: Designed in reverse from villain's POV, leading from trigger to understanding.
4. **Antagonist Reactions** (optional): What bad guys do when investigated.

## Scene Design
- Write scene header with: Title, Type, Lead-In scenes, Lead-Out scenes.
- Each core scene needs at least one core clue pointing to another scene.
- Avoid hard-sequenced core clues (only one possible order).
- Diagram scenes with arrows; ensure multiple paths exist.
- Use floating clues for pacing control.

## Principles
- **Err on giving information, not withholding it.**
- If players propose a plausible alternative ability for a clue, give the clue.
- Use the Investigative Ability Checklist to ensure wide coverage.
- Use the GM's Investigator Roster to track abilities and spread spotlight.
- **Never negate** player contributions. Build on them. Make players half-right.
- When players are stuck: remind them to gather more information. Invoke drives.

## Pacing Tools
- Floating core clues (release based on fun/frustration level)
- Timed results (lab callbacks to redirect or cut scenes)
- SCENE card or musical sting to signal end of a scene
- Antagonist reactions (floating danger scenes to kick up pace)

## Step 1: Concept
Choose a character concept appropriate to the setting. Some settings provide Stereotypes (flavor templates), Packages (ability minimums), or Occupations (half-price abilities + special benefits).

## Step 2: Investigative Abilities
- Points vary by group size: 2 players = 80% of x, 3 = 60%, 4 = 55%, 5+ = 50% (x = total investigative abilities in game).
- GM ensures every ability is covered by at least one PC.
- Even 1 rating point means high professional competence.
- Spread widely; rarely go above 3-4 in any one ability.
- May reserve unspent points to reveal during play.

## Step 3: General Abilities
- 60 build points regardless of group size.
- Concentrate points; you want higher ratings here than in investigative.
- Start with Health 1 and Stability 1 for free.
- Second-highest rating must be >= half of highest.
- Benchmarks: 1-3 sideline, 4-7 solid, 8+ bad-assery.
- Rating 0 = cannot make tests (but can do mundane non-critical tasks).

## Drives (optional by setting)
Personal motivation keeping the character heroically and curiously engaged.

## Packages vs Occupations
- **Packages**: Set minimum ability requirements. Fast and simple.
- **Occupations**: Key abilities at half-price (2 rating per 1 build point). May include Special mechanical benefits.

- 2 minutes before effects. Then lose 1 Athletics per 10 seconds. When Athletics depleted, lose 1 Health per 5 seconds.

## Toxins
- Inhaled: immediate. Injected/ingested: delayed (minutes to hours).
- Damage modifier range: -2 (cleaning substance) to +16 (nerve gas).

- **Shooting Weapons/Damage**: weapon type +/-modifier
- **Hit Threshold**: 3 default (2 for large/slow, 4+ for agile/small/supernatural)
- **Armor**: Subtracted from each damage instance. May be weapon-specific.
- **Alertness Modifier**: Applied to Infiltration/Surveillance difficulties. Second number after slash = without gear.
- **Stealth Modifier**: Alters Surveillance difficulty to spot opponent.
- **Attack Pattern** (optional): Suggested per-round spending. Increase after misses.

## Design Principles
- **Health = dramatic endurance**, not realistic toughness. A thug who should fall to one burst = Health 1-2.
- **Most NPCs need only text description** — stats only for those who must be overcome through general abilities.
- **Always consult story logic first**, attack patterns second.
- **Player-facing**: prefer player tests over GM rolls for supporting characters.
- **False branching**: Don't roll for NPCs when players can't affect the outcome. Just decree it happens.
